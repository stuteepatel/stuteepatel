Using the red plastic cup as the main source of
inspiration and subject for this project, I allude to 
the idea of an after party. I created different
images using various medias to form this
representations. The photos were developed using
scanners, DSLR and Iphone cameras as well
as Photoshop and vector drawings.</div>

Astrology is the study of the plants, stars, moons and their alignments. The western world studies astrology completely differently than the eastern world does. In the United States, it is typically used to define or give understanding to behaviors and actions, where as in Asian countries, astrology is used for predicting favorable dates, outcomes and events. Given that the differentiation is not widely known, I created an interactive website to not only exhibit their differences, but also to display information about Vedic Astrology in a more visual way.
