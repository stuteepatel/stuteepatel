    <p>How could I ignore you?
        Trust me, I adore you.
        Trust me, I adore you.
        We're swimming through our dreams.
        Kiss me in the shower, for a couple hours, though we're only sixteen.
        And sit down beside me,
        Don't call me daddy,
        'Cause that's just fuckin' weird.
        Promise that you'll stay here
        You and I can lay here
        Until the end of time
        But girl,
Well, don't you worry 'bout me.
It ain't new to me
feeling this lonely, darling. Girl, don't worry 'bout me, but if you're ever unhappy
Then maybe, baby, I must let you go
Let you go
Baby now it's best here
To lay me down and rest here
Let's dream of Corduroy
Work for what you love to do
And I will watch right over you
With your heart, I'll never toy
And you're the other half of me
Drink and sleep and laugh with me
Save me from myself
See I'm a fucking basket-case
Until I'm able to see your face
You saved me from myself
But girl
Don't worry 'bout me
'Cause it ain't new to me
Feeling this lonely
Darling baby, girl
Don't worry about me
'Cause if you're ever unhappy
If you're ever unhappy
If you're ever, ever unhappy
Then maybe
Maybe, baby, I must let you go
    </p>
